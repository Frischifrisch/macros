"""This program decreases Windows volume by a certain amount after a certain key is pressed,
   then brings it back up after a certain time or after a certain button is pressed.
   You can also press another button to bring up the console dialogue to change the amount.
   Also it exits if a different certain key is pressed.
   These keys can be seen in veriables: `exit_key` `down_key` `up_key` `change_key`
