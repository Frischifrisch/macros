### AutoHotkey
These are not python but they fit here best. The main thing is a macro for a numpad. [quick link](AutoHotkey)

# python-macros
Press buttons with python!  
This is just a collection of some macros I made because I have found a need for them. Most of them are heavily based on other works, and there are links in comments in the code to show where I got inspiration for certain things. Feel free to take and modify them for your own personal uses, though it is recommended to check the links in the code comments to get it from the source.  

I plan to add a better description of each macro here, but the names should be self explanitory and there are comments inside to help you out.  

The files ending in `.pyw` like `defaultCommands.pyw` are not actual macros but they are imported into others to make them more streamlined. 

These were made for Python 3.7 unless otherwise noted.
