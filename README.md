# python-macros
Press buttons with python!  
This is just a collection of some macros I made because I have found a need for them. Feel free to take and modify them for your own personal uses.  

I plan to add a better description of each macro here, but the names should be self explanitory and there are comments inside to help you out.  

The files ending in `.pyw` like `defaultCommands.pyw` are not actual macros but they are imported into others to make them more streamlined.
